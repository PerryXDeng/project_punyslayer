# Weaponizing Unicode
Weaponizing Unicode is a machine learning solution for finding from 100,000 Unicodes characters that look alike,
which are used in homoglyph domain name attacks, also known as "punycode attacks," as well as social engineering.
For a detailed description of the attack, see https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2017/10/out-of-character-homograph-attacks-explained/. 
Here is Unicode Consortium's current recommendations on dealing with such attacks: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Confusable\_Detection.
