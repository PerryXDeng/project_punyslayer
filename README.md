# Puny Slayer
Puny Slayer is a machine learning solution for finding from 100,000 Unicodes characters that look alike,
which are used in homoglyph domain name attacks, also known as "punycode attacks," as well as social engineering.
For a detailed description of the attack, see https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2017/10/out-of-character-homograph-attacks-explained/. 
Here is Unicode Consortium's current recommendations on dealing with such attacks: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Confusable\_Detection.

## Current Progress
We have implemented various prototypical siamese and triplet networks in numpy, 
tensorflow core, pytorch, and tensorflow 2. We have selected the tensorflow 2 implementation due to simplicity and keras integration.
We have implemented a unicode generation scheme and a transferred EfficientNet with triplet cosine loss.
We are in the process of trouble shooting the unicode generation scheme and implementing hyperparameter optimization.

## CommandLine Execution
Before you run anything, add the top-level folder to the Python path with the command:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/directoryroot
