this is where i backup some of the experiments i do for "fun"

trying to implement this model with tensorflow:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf

but first I will implement a simplistic version of it with numpy and emulate it
with tensorflow to make sure the the tensorflow computational graph can handle
the backpropagation
