# Puny Slayer
Puny Slayer is a machine learning solution for finding from 100,000 Unicodes characters that look alike,
which are used in homoglyph domain name attacks, also known as "punycode attacks," as well as social engineering.
For a detailed description of the attack, see https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2017/10/out-of-character-homograph-attacks-explained/.
## Current Progress
Currently we are trying out different implementations of this experimental neural network:

Before you run anything, add the top-level folder to the Python path with the command:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/directoryroot
