this is where i backup some of the experiments i do for "fun"

trying to implement this model with tensorflow:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf

but first I will implement a simplistic version of it with numpy and emulate it
with tensorflow to make sure that the tensorflow computational graph can handle
the backpropagation of the twin networks

Before you run anything, add the top-level folder to the Python path with the command:
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/directory_root"
