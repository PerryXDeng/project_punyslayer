this directory contains a simple implementation of the siamese twin neural network architecture in numpy

issues:
1. gradients from backpropagation are sometiems the exact negative of what they really are
2. sigmoid activation functions lead to vanishing gradients after a few layers
3. convolutions are not implemented -> does not work well with images
4. no normalization
